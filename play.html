               <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-sm md:text-base">Satta is not currently legal in India, but it is still big business.

               <h3 class="text-sm md:text-base font-semibold mt-3">Pick Numbers</h3>
               <ul class="ml-4 list-disc text-foreground text-xs md:text-sm font-medium space-y-1">
                  <li>You pick (3) three numbers from 0 – 9. </li>
                  <li>For example, 3,5,6 would be your first pick at random. </li>
                  <li>To add more substance to the game, the numbers are then added up (3 + 5 + 6) and a final Satta Matka number is given.</li>
                  <li>In this example, it is 14. You only use one digit of this number, the last one. In this example, it will be the 4.</li>
                  <li>So your first draw would be 3,5,6 *4.</li>

               </ul>
               <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6">How Do You Win At Matka?</h3>
               <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-sm md:text-base">To win at Matka Satta, you have various rate payouts, ranging from 9/1 to 999/1. You can bet on the chance of all numbers coming up to the first, last, or any other type of bet allowed by the Matka gambling bookie. For this reason, it can be an attractive game because of the payout multiples, but the game is merely a game of chance and therefore can not be beaten. It requires luck to win, but many are superstitious about their numbers and always play them, just like the lottery games.</p>
               <h3 class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6">SATTA MATKA FEES &amp; ODDS</h3>
               <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-sm md:text-base">The Satta betting agent should only take a maximum of 5% of your wager amount assuming you win. Because the game is all luck and neither the agent nor the bettor has an advantage, the bookie should take home 5% on every Rupee wagered. Heavy betting on a certain number or combination of numbers can be a dangerous scenario. If those numbers come up, it is very likely your bookie will vanish because he can’t afford to cover the wagers. When the cards and numbers are picked, generally at 9 PM and 12 at night the winners are declared. This is how a payout would occur.</p>
               <br>Example Of A 10 Rupees Bet:
               <ul class="ml-4 list-disc text-sm md:text-base">
                  <li> You choose the correct first number drawn: 9 X Your Wager of 10Rs = 90 Rs.</li>
                  <li> Your second number is drawn: 9 X Your Wager of 10Rs = 90 Rs.</li>
                  <li> You choose the middle number (the jodi) and the first number correct in combination: 90 X Your Wager = 900 Rs.</li>
               </ul>
               <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6">History of SATTA MATKA</h3>
               <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-sm md:text-base">The origins of Indian Matka gambling involve wagering on the daily price of cotton according to the Bombay and the New York Cotton Exchange. Nowadays, Matka betting, or Satta King, is a popular lottery-style game. It involves the selection of random numbers in the hopes of hitting the right number combination. The winner becomes the Satta King and they earn the bulk of the prize pool. The legendary Ratan Khatri is popularly known as the Matka King. After his arrest in 1995, he had to discontinue his games and now crooks are running the game he loved so much by fixing the numbers. A big fall from grace, but his name remains legendary among Satta Matka games in Mumbai.</p>
               <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6">Conclusion on SATTA MATKA</h3>
               <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-sm md:text-base">Big-time enthusiasts still play this game and they remember the days of Ratan having celebrities pull draws for him. The game has since lost most of its following. Indians have chosen the faster-paced action of online cricket betting or live dealer casinos on their mobile devices. IPL betting draws people like nothing else in India and fans wait eagerly to place bets on the event.</p>
